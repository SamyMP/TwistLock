# rules
The Twistlock is a little game played on a rectangular plate with cells.
Each cell hold a random value between 5 and 54.

The players have a limited number of "Twistlocks".
When it is his turn a player capture a cell corner, the player with the most corners of the cell add the value of the cell to his score.
Trying to capture an already captured corner result in a fail and two twistlocks being consumed.

If a player has no twistlock left his turn is passed.
The game end if players have no more twistlocks or if every corner have been captured.
